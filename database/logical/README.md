This directory contains the **logical database model**.

Here, the conceptual model is transformed into a **relational structure**, still independent of any specific DBMS.

## What you will find here
- Tables and columns
- Primary and foreign keys
- Logical diagrams
- Normalized relationships

## What should NOT be here
- DBMS - specific syntax
- Final creation scripts
- Performance tuning

## Purpose of this directory
To practice converting a conceptual model into a logical one, reinforcing relational modeling and data organization concepts.
